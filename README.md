### Useful resources

- [Stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18389224/how-to-style-html5-range-input-to-have-different-color-before-and-after-slider) - The second answer (84 votes) on this thread really helped me in understanding how to change the progress colour on a range input element. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward as it is clean and straight forward.
